As GAIA-X shapes data sovereignty, and Open Services Cloud frames technology sovereignty, both combined provides digital sovereignty.

In details, it means:

- GAIA-X focuses on portability of **cloud data**
- Open Services Cloud focuses on portability of **cloud data processing services** and also fulfills the Data Act's requirements for cloud services portability
- You need to have both portability of data and its associated data processing service to achieve digital sovereignty. One without the other has limited value.
- We implement GAIA-X data portability as services on top of Open Services Cloud to bring together these two features, **data portability and data processing portability££.
