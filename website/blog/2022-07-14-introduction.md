Welcome to Eclipse Open Services Cloud.

Today, the ecosystem is being locked out of public clouds. Only the cloud providers can create native managed services.
The consequence is that it's pretty hard to integrate 3rd party SaaS islands.

On the other hand, the enterprises fear lock-in. There's no real service portability between different clouds.

And even worse, cloud data is the ultimate lock-out and lock-in. The data lock-out means cloud data storage software is
inefficient compare to cloud data storage service. Even if we can have a software storage on a purchased virtual
machine, it's inefficient and expensive compared to native cloud storage services.
The data lock-in is because the cloud data is tightly coupled to prorprietary cloud services. It's hard to
extract/export raw data from one cloud to another. Even if cloud data can be exported, it's not really useful without
the accompanying cloud service.

Open Services Cloud solves:

- **federated**: the goal is to create an open services ecosystem that works across different clouds. Open Services
  Cloud solves ecosystem lockout & lack of service portability.
- **open**: the purpose is to enable customers to choose the services and providers of their choice. Thanks to that, we
  avoid customer lock-in.
- **data infrastructure based on European values**: Open Services Cloud enables European cloud providers and ecosystems
  to meet the needs of Europeans. Open Services Cloud open up the market, avoiding the hyperscalers to control and set
  the market for cloud and data services in Europe.

Open Services Cloud is a Open Source initiative reshaping the cloud market.

Welcome to Open Services Cloud!
